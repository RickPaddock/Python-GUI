This repository contains a selection of small Python scipts which create a GUI using the TKinter library.

Python libraries used:
```
- tkinter
- random
```

1) **Catch Me Game** - This was my first ever time using the TKinter library.  It's a simple game which you can not win! It opens a window and every time you attempt to click the button, it moves. See .... simple!
2) **Traffic Lights** - Very simply, a set of traffic lights which can be changed by pressing a button. 

*More to come soon!*

All the best, 
Rick
