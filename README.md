This repository contains a selection of small Python scipts which create some form of GUI. 

Libraries used:
```
- tkinter
- random
```

### Scripts 
1) **Catch Me Game** - This was my first ever time using the TKinter library.  It's a simple game which you can not win! It opens a window and every time you attempt to click the button, it moves. See .... simple! :+1:

2) **Traffic Lights** - A set of traffic lights which can be changed by pressing a button. Exciting, I know.

3) **Tic Tac Toe** - Play against a really easy-to-beat computer opponent.

*More to come soon!*

All the best, 
Rick
